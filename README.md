## Windows Download (EXE)

For Windows users:  
Download the latest standalone EXE from the [Releases page](https://github.com/chrmccar/vibra_carbon_copy/releases).

- No Python install required!
- Double-click `vibra_carbon_copy.exe` to launch the app.
- The first time you run it, a `data` folder will be created automatically.

## Windows Source (.py)

pip install -r requirements.txt

## macOS Source (.py)

Neither of the above will work, but I assume using vibra_carbon_copy_mac.py will work although I don't have a mac to test.
